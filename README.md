This repository contains a complete implementation of a logistic regression model for classifying breast tumors as malignant or benign using the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset. The project demonstrates core machine learning workflows including data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and interpretation with comprehensive visualizations.
