This repository contains a complete implementation of a logistic regression model for classifying breast tumors as malignant or benign using the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset. The project demonstrates core machine learning workflows including data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and interpretation with comprehensive visualizations.

The Breast Cancer Wisconsin Diagnostic Dataset contains 569 samples with 30 features computed from digitized images of fine needle aspirates (FNA) of breast masses. Features describe characteristics of cell nuclei like:
